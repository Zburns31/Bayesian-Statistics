# What is it?
- The Pareto distribution is a power-law probability distribution, and has only two parameters to describe the distribution: $\alpha$ (“alpha”) and $X_m%
    - The $\alpha$ value is the shape parameter of the distribution, which determines how distribution is sloped
    - The $X_m$ parameter is the scale parameter, which represents the minimum possible value for the distribution and helps to determine the distribution’s spread
