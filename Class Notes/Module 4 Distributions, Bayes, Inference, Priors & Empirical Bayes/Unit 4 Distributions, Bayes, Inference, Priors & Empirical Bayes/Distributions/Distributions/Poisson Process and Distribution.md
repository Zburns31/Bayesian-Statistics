# Poisson Process

- A Poisson Process is a model for a series of discrete event where the *average time* between events is known, but the exact timing of events is random
    - The arrival of an event is independent of the event before (waiting time between events [is memoryless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorylessness))
        - The memoryless property (also called the forgetfulness property) means that a given [probability distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/probability-distribution/) is independent of its history
            - Any time may be marked down as time zero
- It gives the probability of an event happening a certain number of times (*k*) within a given interval of time or space


- A [Poisson Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process#Poisson_distribution_of_point_counts) meets the following criteria (in reality many phenomena modeled as Poisson processes don’t meet these exactly):
    1. Events are **independent** of each other. The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability another event will occur
    2. The average rate (events per time period) is constant
    3. Two events cannot occur at the same time

# Poisson Distribution

- The **Poisson Process** is the model we use for describing randomly occurring events and by itself, isn’t that useful. We need the **Poisson Distribution** to do interesting things like finding the probability of a number of events in a time period or finding the probability of waiting some time until the next event
    - The Poisson Distribution probability mass function gives the probability of observing **k** events in a time period (interval) given the length of the period and the average events per time
- **Probability Mass Function Equation**

    $P(k \space events \space per \space time \space period) = e^{-\dfrac {events} {time} * \space time \space period} * \dfrac {(\dfrac {events} {time} * time \space period) ^k} {k!}$ == $P(k  \space events \space in \space interval) = \dfrac {\lambda^k * e^{-k}} {k!}$

    - **Rate Parameter:** Lambda can be thought of as the *expected number of events in the interval*
        - The most likely number of events in the interval for each curve is the **rate parameter - $\lambda$**
- When it’s not an integer, the highest probability number of events will be the nearest integer to the rate parameter, since the Poisson distribution is only defined for a discrete number of events.
    - The discrete nature of the Poisson distribution is also why this is a probability **mass**  function and not a **density**  function. (The rate parameter is also the mean and variance of the distribution, which do not need to be integers)
- **Note:** The expected value of a Poisson distribution is equal to its parameter: $E[Z|\lambda] = \lambda$



# Likelihood Function

- Suppose that $X = (X_1, X_2, ...X_n)$ are iid observations from a Poisson distribution with unknown parameter $\lambda$. The likelihood function is:

$$
L(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i;\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^n \dfrac{\lambda^{x_i}e^{-\lambda}}{x_i!} = \dfrac{\lambda^{\sum_i x_i}e^{-n \lambda}}{x_1!\cdot x_2! ... \cdot x_n!}
$$

## Use Cases:

1. Find the probability of observing a number of events over an interval generated by a Poisson process
2. Find the probability of waiting some time between events

# Numerical Characteristics

- **PMF:** $P(X=k|\lambda) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$
- **CDF:** $F(k|\lambda) = e^{-\lambda}\sum_{i=0}^{k} \frac{\lambda^i}{i!}$
- **Mean:** $\lambda$
- **Mode:** $\lambda - 1$
- **Variance:** $\lambda$
- **Support:** $\{0, 1, 2, ...\}$
- **Parameters:** $\lambda (rate)$
- **Notation:** $X \sim Poi(\lambda)$
